# Unit Testing Kata

- We are here to getting started and practice JUnit Testing with a real problem. 

- We are going to work with [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

----

## Getting started

This Kata is about a problem found in a real project, but in this case we will simplify a little.

This repository contains one project that is an Android application but empty, for this workshop is enough 
because the objective is put in practice TDD and start to change our way to work to integrate this mentality.

The problem: **THE SHOPPING BASKET**

## Recommendations before starting

- Fork this repository
